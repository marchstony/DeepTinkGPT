让GPT以类似Deepseek的方式思考和回答问题，但存在以下问题：
1.使用的是我的APIKEY,暂时还没有做让用户输入自己的KEY的功能
2.因为是用元指令进行的系统设定实现，想给AI加上新的设定变得十分困难，例如扮猫娘 
3.版本非常原始，连新开聊天的功能都没有，需要退出重进

Ask GPT to think and answer questions in a Deepseek similar way, but with the following problems:
1. I use my APIKEY, and I haven't done the function of letting users enter their own KEY
2. Because it is implemented with meta-commands, it is very difficult to add new settings to the AI, such as pretending to be a cat lady
3. The version is very primitive, and there is no function to even open a new chat, so you need to exit and re-enter
